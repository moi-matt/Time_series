# Time_series

This repo contains several of my time series projects :

- __Air traffic prediction__ where statistical time series models (exponential, holt-winters...) are used to predict the number of flights in the world since 2010.
- __Consumable sales prediction__ where the purpose is to predict the consumable sales of an industrial printer company. Statiscal and machine learning models are used.
